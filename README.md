• Create an account: When a user clicks on this menu option, a login creation page loads into the content area with text fields for a username and one for a password as well as a description of the allowed formats for usernames and passwords. If the requested username already exists, the server sends back a message requesting a new username/password pair informing the user that this username is not available. If the username is not already in use, then write this new pair to the login file and return a message to the content area confirming that the account was successfully created and that they are now ready to login whenever they are ready.<br/>
• Have a pet to give away: <br/>
<ul>
   <li>  When a user clicks on this menu option, they will first be asked to login. </li>
   <li>  When the user clicks the Submit button, the server will check by reading the login file that this login pair exists. If it is a registered login/password pair a new session is started and the form is loaded into the content area. If the pair does not exist, a message is send back to the browser.</li>
   <li> Once they have successfully logged in, they are ready to fill out the form and submit it.</li>
