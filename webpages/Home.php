    		<p>Our organization was founded on the belief that animals are entitled to kind and respectful treatment at the hands of humans and must be protected under the law. In Montreal Wenlu's Cats&Dogs maintains a strong local presence, and with programs that extend our anti-cruelty mission across the country, we are recognized as a national animal welfare organization. We are a privately funded not-for-profit corporation, and are proud to boast many supporters across the country.</p><br/>
